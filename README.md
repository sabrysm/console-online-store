# console-online-store
This is an OOP project for the following course: https://www.udemy.com/course/java-development-for-beginners-learnit

# Project Description
EXAM! Implement console program which will meet the following requirements:

You have to implement a backend for an online shop. The system should support such basic operations as:
User registration
User sign in and sign out
Product catalog navigation
Adding product to cart
Submitting an order
Checkout
Users management
And others

This code will be used in further education and next topics and will end up with creating your web e-commerce application.

*** MENU NAVIGATION ***

Scenario - main menu
GIVEN I’m an app user
WHEN I run the program
THEN I see the main menu

Tech notes:
Main menu consists of the next items:
Sign Up
Sign In / Sign Out 
Product Catalog
My Orders
Settings
Customer List


When User is logged in, then paragraph 2 label is changed to “Sign Out” instead of Sign In.

Scenario - stop the program
GIVEN I’m an app user
AND I’m in main menu
WHEN I enter ‘exit’ in console
THEN program execution is stopped

Scenario - incorrect input handling
GIVEN I’m an app user
WHEN I entered any digit except 1, or 2, or 3, or 4, or 5
THEN I see the error message “Only 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is allowed. Try one more time.”
AND I navigated back to the main menu

*** SIGN UP ***

Scenario - new user sign up
GIVEN I’m an app user

AND I asked to enter my password
AND I asked to enter my email
AND application successfully registered me
AND I see notification that ‘New user is created’
AND I navigated back to main menu
AND instead of ‘Sign In’ I see ‘Sign Out’ label

Technical note:
Each new user should have an ID.
The ID number should be automatically incremented for each new user (static counter field should be a part of DefaultUser class)

Scenario - new user sign up - unique email successful validation
GIVEN I’m an app user
AND I see main menu in console
WHEN I entered 1
AND I selected ‘Sign Up’ in main menu
THEN registration process is started
AND I asked to enter my first name
AND I asked to enter my last name
AND I asked to enter my password
AND I asked to enter my email
AND I enter unique email

AND I see notification that ‘new user is created’
AND I navigated back to main menu
AND instead of ‘Sign In’ I see ‘Sign Out’ label


Scenario - new user sign up - unique email unsuccessful validation
GIVEN I’m an app user

AND I asked to enter my last name
AND I asked to enter my password
AND I asked to enter my email

THEN Login process is started
AND I asked to enter my email
AND I asked to enter my password
AND credentials are valid
AND I see welcome message ‘Glad to see you back <First Name> <Last Name>’
AND I see main menu
AND instead of ‘Sign In’ I see ‘Sign Out’ label

Scenario - unsuccessful sign in
GIVEN I’m an app user
AND I have registered account

=== Technical details ===

General technical requirements: 
1) instance of each service (UserManagementService, OrderManagementService, ProductManagementService, ApplicationContext) exist in a single copy during the program execution. Access to the single copy is possible via static getInstance() method of each specific type. And I can’t create objects of these types via constructor.

2) Each implementation of service should have this method 

	void clearServiceState()

for the sake of testing. This method should reset state of service to default. Taking into account the instance of each service will be in single copy, our tests have to have method that will clear the state of the service to reproduce different test cases.
To reset user counter - implement clearState() method in the DefaultUser class.

3) During implementation of this task you have to implement next interfaces:
public interface Cart {

	boolean isEmpty();

	void addProduct(Product productById);

	Product[] getProducts();

	void clear();

}


public interface Order {

	boolean isCreditCardNumberValid(String userInput);

	void setCreditCardNumber(String userInput);

	void setProducts(Product[] products);

	void setCustomerId(int customerId);
	
	int getCustomerId();

}


public interface Product {

	int getId();

	String getProductName();

}


public interface User {
	
	String getFirstName();
	String getLastName();
	String getPassword();
	String getEmail();
	int getId();
	
	void setPassword(String newPassword);
	void setEmail(String newEmail);
	
	
}


public interface Menu {

	void start();
	
	void printMenuHeader();
}


public interface OrderManagementService {

	void addOrder(Order order);

	Order[] getOrdersByUserId(int userId);

Order[] getOrders();
}


public interface ProductManagementService {

	Product[] getProducts();

	Product getProductById(int productIdToAddToCart);

}


public interface UserManagementService {

	String registerUser(User user);
	
	User[] getUsers();

	User getUserByEmail(String userEmail);

}



And here is the class of ApplicationContext which will help you during implementation of this program:
public class ApplicationContext {
	
	private static ApplicationContext instance;
	
	private User loggedInUser;
	private Menu mainMenu;
	private Cart sessionCart;
	
	private ApplicationContext() {
	}
	
	public void setLoggedInUser(User user) {
		if (this.sessionCart != null) {
			this.sessionCart.clear(); // we have to clear session cart when new user is logged in
		}
		this.loggedInUser = user;
	}
	
	public User getLoggedInUser() {
		return this.loggedInUser;
	}
	
	public void setMainMenu(Menu menu) {
		this.mainMenu = menu;
	}
	
	public Menu getMainMenu() {
		return this.mainMenu;
	}

	public static ApplicationContext getInstance() {
		if (instance == null) {
			instance = new ApplicationContext();
		}
		return instance;
	}

	public Cart getSessionCart() {
		if (this.sessionCart == null) {
			this.sessionCart = new DefaultCart();
		}
		return this.sessionCart;
	}

}
